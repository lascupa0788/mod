 # Electronics Localisation
 electronic_engineering:0 "Ohm´s Law"
 electronic_engineering_desc:0 "Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points. It is quintessential for anything remotely related to electricity."
 electronic_engineering_1:0 "Resistor"
 electronic_engineering_1_desc:0 "A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses. High-power resistors that can dissipate many watts of electrical power as heat, may be used as part of motor controls, in power distribution systems, or as test loads for generators."
 electronic_engineering_2:0 "Vaccum Tubes"
 electronic_engineering_2_desc:0 "A vacuum tube, an electron tube, is a device that controls electric current between electrodes in an evacuated container. Vacuum tubes mostly rely on thermionic emission of electrons from a hot filament or a heated cathode. This type is called a thermionic tube or thermionic valve. A phototube, however, achieves electron emission through the photoelectric effect. "

Though input is slow, a user can also hand-enter and edit text messages on the Pip-Boy 2000. Also available in gold, white and blue."
 electronic_engineering_7:0 "ZAX Technology"
 electronic_engineering_7_desc:0 "Developed by Vault-Tec, Zax is a series of advanced supercomputers capable of learning, independent thought and creativity, with added error insertion to improve its variance in experience and learning capability. ZAX 1.0, the original prototype, went online in 2054. Initially a prototype of some of the systems designed to govern the Vaults, it was given to the federal government to help the Department of Energy collect resource data. Within a year, it was taken by the American military for plague and tactical research; one version of the machine, ZAX 1.2, was constructed for the defense contractor West Tek."

 medic_methods_5_desc:0 "Radiography is an imaging technique using X-rays to view the internal structure of an object. To create the image, a beam of X-rays, a form of electromagnetic radiation, are produced by an X-ray generator and are projected toward the object. A certain amount of X-ray is absorbed by the object, dependent on its density and composition. The X-rays that pass through the object are captured behind the object by a detector (either photographic film or a digital detector). The generation of flat two dimensional images by this technique is called projectional radiography."
